# Introduction

This repo contains my notes on the [Rasa Advanced Deployment Workshop](https://www.udemy.com/course/rasa-advanced-deployment-workshop/).

All scripts were run on an AWS EC2 instance with this image:

* AMI Name: Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 33.0 AMI
* AMI ID: ami-079d181e97ab77906

# Usage

Run the commands in each script in the sequence named i.e. start with [00_setup.sh](./00_setup.sh), [01_install_microk8s.sh](./01_install_microk8s.sh), ... , [13_cicd.sh](./13_cicd.sh).
